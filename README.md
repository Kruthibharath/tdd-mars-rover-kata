# Mars Rover TypeScript project with Tests

- To create a program to move rovers around the surface of Mars!
- The surface of Mars is represented by a Plateau.(Rectangle/Square Grid)

## Breaking into simple steps and implementing RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology

- Create a grid with given x and y coordinates

- Check for the rover is positioned within the bounds of the plateau.

- define functions for rover movement : Left, Right, Forward

- If success, function to take input for the rover for its position(coordinates) and direction (N,E,S,W)

- Hoping to reach this step without any issues/failing tests

- Great!! Good attempt, keep up the work and spirit to achieve the result.
